## About

I am currently a $4^{th}$ year Computer Science student at the University of Havana.
I consider myself a hardworking and deeply commited student. I also like to think of
myself as a fast learner. I enjoy teaching, programming, and learning about tech.

I've been learning about blockchain technology for a while. I find blockchain security
really interesting, and I'm currently studying and working my way through this realm.
